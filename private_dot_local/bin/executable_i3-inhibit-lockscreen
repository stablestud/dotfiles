# This script manages timeout and automatic lockscreen functions for the i3 window manager.

# If a window is fullscreen, the script will prevent the lockscreen from activating.
# This is useful when watching videos,
# making sure that the screen does not lock and disrupt the viewing experience.
#
# As arguments it takes the lockscreen command to execute if no fullscreen is active.
